protected
the protected access modifier means that the class, method, or variable can only be accessed within the same package or a subclass

default
the default access modifier means that the class, method, or variable can only be accessed within the same package


class

the class is the blueprint for the object

the class is the template for the object

the class is the definition for the object

the class is the model for the object

the class is the prototype for the object

the class is the pattern for the object

create class methods and class variables

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    // public means that the method can be accessed from anywhere
    // static means that the method belongs to the class and not the object
    // void means that the method does not return a value
    // main is the name of the method
    // String[] args is the parameter

    // the parameter is the argument to the method
    // the parameter is the value that is passed to the method

        System.out.println("Hello World");
        // System is a class
        // out is a variable
        // println is a method
        // "Hello World" is a string
        // the string is the argument to the method
