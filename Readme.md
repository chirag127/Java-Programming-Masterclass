* JavaFX Contacts Desktop Application
* Music Player Desktop Application
* JavaFX Challenge

## Progress

I'll be updating this repository as I continue to work through the course, adding new projects and assignments as I go. If you're interested in following along or using this repository as a reference for your own Java programming studies, feel free to clone or fork the repository.

## Contact
