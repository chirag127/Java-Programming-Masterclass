Statements Whitespace and Indentation Code Organization

Statements are the basic unit of code in Java. A statement is a complete line of code that the Java interpreter can execute. A statement can be as simple as a single variable declaration, or it can be a complex expression that performs a calculation.

Whitespace and Indentation

Whitespace is the space between words and characters in a program. Whitespace is used to make the program easier to read. Whitespace is ignored by the Java interpreter.

Indentation is the process of indenting or aligning code to make it easier to read. Indentation is used to show the structure of the code. Indentation is ignored by the Java interpreter.

Code Organization

Code organization is the process of organizing code to make it easier to read. Code organization is used to show the structure of the code. Code organization is ignored by the Java interpreter.
