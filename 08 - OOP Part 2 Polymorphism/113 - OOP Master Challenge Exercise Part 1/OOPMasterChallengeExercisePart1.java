        // be added to the burgers and pricing.

        // that are popular ones in
        // Bills store.

        // bread roll type, meat and up to 4 additional additions (things like lettuce,
        // tomato, carrot, etc) that
        // the customer can select to be added to the burger. Each one of these items

        // price so you need some way to track how many items got added and to calculate
        // the price (for the base
        // burger and all the additions).

        // Create a Hamburger class to deal with all the above.

        // Also create two extra varieties of Hamburgers (classes) to cater for
        // a) Healthy burger (on a brown rye bread roll), plus two addition items can be
        // added.
        // The healthy burger can have a total of 6 items (Additions) in total.
        // hint: you probably want to process the 2 additional items in this new class,
        // not the base class,
        // since the 2 additions are only appropriate for this new class.
        // b) Deluxe hamburger - comes with chips and drinks as additions, but no extra
        // additions are allowed.
        // hint: You have to find a way to automatically add these new additions at the
        // time the deluxe burger
        // object is created, and then prevent other additions being made.
        // All 3 classes should have a method that can be called anytime to show the
        // base price of the hamburger
        // plus all additionals, each showing the addition name, and addition price, and
        // a grand total for the
        // burger

        // class for pricing and then
