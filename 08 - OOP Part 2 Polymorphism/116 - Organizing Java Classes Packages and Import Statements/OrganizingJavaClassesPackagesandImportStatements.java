/** notes
 *
 * Package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.
 *
 * A package name is the same as the directory (folder) name which contains the .java files.
 *
 * Package names are written in all-lowercase letters, and if multiple words are used to
 * separate them, each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter.
 *
 * Package names are part of the type name, so they must be unique.
 *
 * import statement is used to make the compiler aware of the classes that are used in the program.
 *
 * import statement must be written before the class declaration.
 *
 * import statement can be used to import classes from the same package.
 *
 * import statement can be used to import classes from different packages.
 *
 * import statement can be used to import all classes from a package.
 *
 * import statement can be used to import all classes from a package and its subpackages.
 *
 * import statement can be used to import classes from the java.lang package.
 *
 * import statement can be used to import classes from a specific class.
 *
 * import statement can be used to import classes from the same package using the wildcard
 * character (*).
 *
 * import statement can be used to import classes from different packages using the wildcard
 * character (*).
 *
 * import statement can be used to import all classes from a package using the wildcard
 * character (*).
 *
 * import statement can be used to import all classes from a package and its subpackages using
 * the wildcard character (*).
 *
 * import statement can be used to import classes from the java.lang package using the wildcard

 * import statement can be used to import classes from the same package using the static
 * modifier.
