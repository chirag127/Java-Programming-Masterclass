Hello World

This is the first program that you will write in Java. It is a simple program that prints the words "Hello World" to the screen. The program is very simple, but it is a good starting point for learning Java.

The program is saved in a file called HelloWorld.java. The file name must match the class name exactly. The file name is case sensitive, so HelloWorld.java is not the same as helloworld.java.

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
